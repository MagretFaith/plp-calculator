Advanced Calculator Pro

A feature-rich Python-based desktop calculator with Standard, Scientific, and Currency conversion modes. Built with `tkinter` for a responsive GUI, background exchange-rate fetching, and history tracking.

Features

Standard Mode: Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, sign toggle, backspace).
Scientific Mode: Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms (log10, ln), powers (square, cube, exponentiation), roots (square root, cube root), constants (Ï€, e).
Currency Mode: Real-time currency conversion using `exchangerate-api.com` with automatic fallback rates, quick-conversion presets, and live rate display.
Keyboard Support: Use number keys, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `Enter` to calculate, `Backspace` to delete, `Esc` to clear.
Calculation History: Shows the last two operations for quick reference.
Threaded API Calls: Exchange rates load in the background to keep the UI responsive.
